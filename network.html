                    <li>CSMA/CD Ethernet: "Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Detection" dictates that each message be broadcast to all machines on the bus but only the intended recipient keeps the message. A machine waits for the bus to go silent before transmitting a message and if a collision is detected both machines go silent for a random period of time before trying again.</li>
                    <li>CSMA/CA Wifi: "Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance" Prioritizes avoiding collisions as opposed to detection. The most common approach is to give advantage to machines that have already been waiting. The machine only transmits its message after a brief pause in which it waits to see if the channel remains silent. If the channel is busy, the machine waits for a random amount of time before trying again. </li>

                    <li>transport layer: accepts messages from the application layer and ensures that the messages are properly formatted for transmission by dividing long messages into smaller segments which are transferred sequentially. This layer adds sequences of numbers to the smaller segments so that they can be reassembled on the other side and then transfers these packets to the network layer.</li>
                    <li>network layer: This layer is tasked with deciding which direction a packet should be sent at each step along the packet's path through the Internet.</li>
                    <li>link layer: This layer is tasked with transferring the packet. This layer deals with the communication details particular to the individual network. For example it applies a different protocol based on if the computer is apart of a WiFi or Ethernet network.</li>

The virus usually transfer themselves to other programs but can perform more nefarious actions such as degrading the computer in various manners.</li>
                    <li>worm: an autonomous program that transfers itself through a network and takes up residence in computers and forwards copies of itself to other computers. Can merely replicate, or can destroy.</li>
                    <li>Trojan horse: a program that enters a computer disguised as somethig desirable and innocuous. Once in the computer the Trojan performs additional activities either immediately or after a period of dormancy dictated by a specific event.</li>

                    <li>DoS: "Denial of Service" is an atack in which the computer is overloaded with messages. In order to achieve this, the attacker plants software on numerous computers that will generate messages when a signal is given.</li>
