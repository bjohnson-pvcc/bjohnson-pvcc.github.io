                    <td>Chapter 13: Insurrection</td>
                    <td><p>This law was enacted in 1807 and endows the President of the United States with the power to deploy
                        US military and National Guard troops inside the United States for the purpose of suppressing civil
                        disorder, insurrection, and rebellion. This law acts as a counterbalance to the Posse Comitatus Act of
                        1878 which restricts the use of military force for law enforcement purposes within the United States.
                        Prior to invoking the Insurrection Act, the President is required to first publicly order the insurgents to
                        disperse. The three main circumstances under which this law can be invoked are: 1) When requested by a state's legislature to address an insurrection against that state. 2) To address an insurrection in any state when it is not practical to enforce the law. 3) To address an insurrection in any state which results in the deprivation of constitutional rights and where the state cannot or will not protect those rights. The act has been modified twice: in 1861 a section was added which allowed for federal use of the National Guard against the will of the state government, this was done in anticipation of civil unrest following the civil war. In 1871 the Third Enforcement Act revised the law to protect Blacks from the Klu
                        Klux Klan by adding language that allowed the federal government to use the act to enforce the EqualmProtection Clause of the 14 th Amendment which was invoked during the Reconstruction era and a second time during the desegregation fights in the Civil Rights Era.</p>
                        <p>The Act has been used regularly throughout history, examples include conflicts with Native Americans, labor conflicts in the 19-20 th centuries, desegregation in the 20 th century. More recently it was used to quell looting in the wake of Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and again in 192 during the Los Angeles Riots.
                        George W. Bush considered using it in the wake of Hurricane Katrina against the wishes of the Louisiana governor, however, there was no past precedent that would justify it's use in this particular scenario</p></td>

                        without the approval of congress. It states that the president can mobilize military forces only by a
                        declaration of war by Congress, statutory authorization, or in the case of a national emergency. The act
                        requires that the president notify Congress within 48 hours of mobilizing the armed forces and forbids
                        those armed forces from remaining mobilized for more than 60 days without congressional
                        authorization or a declaration of war.</td>
