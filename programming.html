    <h3>Software Testing is Done to Detect:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Architectural flaws</li>
            <li>Poor design decisions</li>
            <li>Invalid or incorrect functionality</li>
            <li>Security vulnerabilities</li>
            <li>Scalability issues</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Testing Best Practices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Continuous Testing: Development and operations collaborate over the entire product life cycle. The aim is to accelerate software delivery while balancing cost, quality and risk. With this testing technique, teams don't need to wait for the software to be built before testing starts. They can run tests much earlier in the cycle to discover defects sooner, when they are easier to fix.</li>
            <li>Configuration Managment: Organizations centrally maintain test assets and track what software builds to test. Teams gain access to assets such as code, requirements, design documents, models, test scripts and test results. Good systems include user authentication and audit trails to help teams meet compliance requirements with minimal administrative effort.</li>
            <li>Service Virtualization: Testing environments may not be available, especially early in code development. Service virtualization simulates the services and systems that are missing or not yet completed, enabling teams to reduce dependencies and test sooner. They can reuse, deploy and change a configuration to test different scenarios without having to modify the original environment.</li>
            <li>Defect or "bug tracking": Monitoring defects is important to both testing and development teams for measuring and improving quality. Automated tools allow teams to track defects, measure their scope and impact, and uncover related issues.</li>
            <li>Metrics and Reporting: Reporting and analytics enable team members to share status, goals and test results. Advanced tools integrate project metrics and present results in a dashboard. Teams quickly see the overall health of a project and can monitor relationships between test, development and other project elements.</li>
        </ul>
